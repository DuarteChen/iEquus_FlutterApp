# 🐴 iEquus – Flutter Mobile App

**iEquus** is a mobile application developed in **Flutter** that helps horse owners and veterinarians estimate a horse's **weight** and **body condition score (BCS)** using machine learning.

The app allows the user to take a photo of the horse, select key body points, and receive a prediction generated by a Flask backend API.

---

## 📱 Features

- Capture and preview horse images using the device camera
- Select 14 key anatomical points on the image
- Submit data to a Flask API for weight and BCS prediction
- View prediction results in an intuitive interface
- Store and review past predictions
- Built with a clean and scalable architecture using Flutter

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **Provider** for state management
- **Camera** and **Image Picker** packages
- **HTTP** for API communication
- **CustomPaint** and **GestureDetector** for point selection on images

---

## 📸 How It Works

1. The user takes a side photo of a horse.
2. The app prompts the user to mark 14 predefined body points.
3. These coordinates, along with the image, are sent to a Flask server.
4. The backend uses a machine learning model to predict the horse’s weight and BCS.
5. The response is displayed in the app.

### 📡 Backend

The app communicates with a Flask-based API that handles:
- Image and coordinate processing
- Machine learning predictions
- Database persistence
